# To Do

* Need to make the local single plot work correctly (i.e., when a test is deleted
  it should remove the active single plot curve.) Needs to work well with import test,
  delete test, etc etc.
* Add functionality to remove the a test from the test list.
* Add functionality to move tests up and down in the test list.
* Add functionality to rename tests.
* Begin adding the load/save functionality so that this can be worked on as the project progresses (rather than trying to do it all at the end). This will make development easier because we won't have to load in the tests every time we launch the GUI.
* Change the listbox to a table on the Test Suite tab.
  * Can add columns for test name, stress difference, plot color, and an active checkbox. 

# Done
