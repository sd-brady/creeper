# To Do

* Add Combo Box to Plot Color on the TestInputDialog.
* Add a Combo box to the "Active Status" on the TestInputDialog
* Add functionality to edit the test information on the test suite tab.
* Add unit functionality. (this will get it's own development branch)

* bug with edit test button when no tests

# Later
* Begin adding the load/save functionality so that this can be worked on as the project progresses (rather than trying to do it all at the end). This will make development easier because we won't have to load in the tests every time we launch the GUI.
